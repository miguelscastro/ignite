# PizzaShop — Frontend

Front-end for PizzaShop (Ignite exercise). Built with React + Vite and intended to pair with `pizzashop-api`.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and a package manager (npm / pnpm)

---

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
cd react/04-pizzashop/pizzashop-web
# using npm
npm install
npm run dev
# or with pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the app at the port printed by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## ⚙️ Notes
- There is a corresponding backend at `react/04-pizzashop/pizzashop-api` — start it first if the front-end depends on API endpoints.
- Environment variables and test configuration may be present (`.env.test`, Playwright config). See `package.json` and `playwright.config.ts`.

Happy hacking! ✅
