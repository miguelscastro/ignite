# Ignite Timer

Timer app built with React + TypeScript (Ignite exercise). This folder contains the course project and example tests.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm (or yarn/pnpm)

---

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
cd react/02-ignite-timer
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app at the port printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## 🧪 Tests
- Check `package.json` for test scripts (Playwright/E2E or unit tests).

---

## 🔗 Notes
- This folder already contains `readme.md` (lowercase) with course notes — this `README.md` standardizes tooling and quick-start steps.

Happy coding! ✅
